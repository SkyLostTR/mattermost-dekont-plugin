# Contributing to Mattermost PDF Dekont Parser Plugin

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

* Use `gofmt` for formatting
* Follow Go naming conventions
* Write clear, self-documenting code
* Add comments for complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
- `feat: add support for multiple bank formats`
- `fix: handle PDF parsing errors gracefully`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Go 1.21+
   - Git
   - VS Code (recommended)

2. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkyLostTR/mattermost-dekont-plugin.git
   cd mattermost-dekont-plugin
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Build and test**:
   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o plugin
   go test ./...
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions
- Aim for >80% test coverage

### Test Structure
```go
func TestExtractFields(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid bank receipt",
            input:    "ALICI: John Doe\nAÃ‡IKLAMA: Payment\nTUTARI: 100.00 TL",
            expected: "**AÃ§Ä±klama**: Payment\n**AlÄ±cÄ±**: John Doe\n**Ä°ÅŸlem TutarÄ±**: 100.00 TL",
        },
        // Add more test cases
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := extractFields(tt.input)
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("extractFields() = %v, want %v", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```
